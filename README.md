# House Hunter

All base functionality is complete.

## Working Features
 * Backend data storage
 * Property Listing View
 * Property View
 * Property Editor
 * Adding Properties
 * Map View Intent
 * Landscape interfaces
 * Filtering & Sorting, these are properly toggelable
 * Long touch on listview deletes with a confirmation
 * Zillow Integration

## Usage Guidelines

Please use it as you would normally use any other app. The map tab on the main screen opens the map to a preset location and adds a random test address to the list, mostly for testing purposes. This will be removed before the final release.

## Changes from RFP
 * Maps are no longer embedded
 * Tabs are not used as they have no immediate purpose.
